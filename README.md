## Ethi:CS -- The Weekly Ethicacy
At the beginning of each session, a designated duo will present on a topic of interest to them (and hopefully all of us!).

- Deliverables:

  Add a PDF to both of your **ethicacy** folders of your repos. The  PDF should contain:
  - hyperlink(s) to primary source(s) 
  - summary of newsworthy development or issue
  - single page
  - add to this folder in git repo via pull request

  You can also add any other supporting files to your ethicacy folder but make sure both partners folders contain all the files.
  
  
- Presentation
  - _ideal: Each partner takes a side (of an at-least-2-sided issue), and audience gets to hear each argument._
  - ~7 - 10 min
    - (shorter: topic not rich enough)
    - (longer: topic not distilled enough)
  - solicit questions/comments/concerns
